# Discord Bot Project

Welcome to the Discord Bot Project! This repository houses a Python-based Discord bot that's designed to enhance your server experience. Whether you're looking to streamline administrative tasks, introduce fun interactions, or provide informative responses, this bot has got you covered.

## Features

- **Custom Commands:** Interact with the bot using a set of predefined commands or create your own to suit your server's unique needs.
- **Music:** Elevate your server's ambiance with integrated music features. 
  
## Getting Started

To get the bot up and running on your server, follow these steps:

1. Obtain a bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Configure the bot by editing **`bot.py`** and adding your token
3. Run the bot using **`python bot.py`**
4. (**Optional**:remove  comments(#) in **`bot.py`** to connect to **`keep_alive.py`** so that you can add this bot on an online server)

## Usage

Once the bot is up and running on your server, you can interact with it using the prefix **`;;`**. For example, to trigger a custom command, simply type **`;;command-name`**.

## Configuration

In the **`bot.py`** file, you can configure various aspects of the bot, including the token, command prefix, and other customizable settings.
